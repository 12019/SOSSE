[THIS IS MY RESEARCH BRANCH, NOT FOR PUBLIC USE!]

This TODO list probably does not correlate to <origin/master> TO-DO.txt, and for good reason. If
you want to see changes to the source-code you should see the master branch file instead.

{TODO Research}
[_] - Figure out how to easily SEND and RECEIVE bytes, WHY IS THIS SO FUCKING HARD TO DO?
[_] - Write code to correctly respond to PPA meter, make it stupid simple to start
[_] - Create a function to change the SERNUM_ADDR (4-Byte) values during a single session (might have to force a RESET between)
[_] - Designate EEPROM storage for my CSC1 "database" include corresponding CSN values (SERNUM_ADDR)

{TODO Source Code}
[_] - Why is EEPROM reading out as all 0xFF's when I send test command (80 04 FF 00 FF) "read EEPROM 00-FF, length of FF"
[_] - Why doesn't "make -f Makefile.emu" work -- looking for <sio/sio.h>
